# Magento2: Docker setup
This repository automates the setup described in this tutorial by Shawn Abramson, with a few updates: https://www.magemodule.com/all-things-magento/magento-2-tutorials/docker-magento-2-development/

You will be asked for your Magento credentials - you can save them globally on your system after the first installation.
